Some features image in Facebook doesn't work.

Remember to change the Site Name where it says “Your Site Name Goes Here”. Also change the default image URL with the image of yours. We would recommend putting an image with your logo there, so if your post does not have a thumbnail, then it pulls your site’s logo. Studies show that posts shared without a thumbnail are less effective than those with thumbnails. Also don’t forget to add your USER ID. You can find your Facebook user ID by going to this URL: http://graph.facebook.com/@username (Just replace @username with your own username).

if you are not sure user Yoast SEO.
