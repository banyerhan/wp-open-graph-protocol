Some features image in Facebook doesn't work.

Remember to change the Site Name where it says “your_site_name_here”. Also change the default image URL with the image of yours. We would recommend putting an image with your logo there, so if your post does not have a thumbnail, then it pulls your site’s logo. Studies show that posts shared without a thumbnail are less effective than those with thumbnails. Also don’t forget to add your your_page_id_here. You can find your Facebook user ID by going to this URL: http://graph.facebook.com/@username (Just replace @username with your own username).

if you are not sure user Yoast SEO.
